                            In preparation for one of my courses at UBC, I picked up Jon Duckett's <a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> book from the nearest Amazon and created this page as a means to experiment with the front-end environment. As I got further into the book, I started forgetting what I had previously read in the book. So, I decided to transform the experimental webpage into my very own online profile page as a way to solidify what I have learned. What was originally supposed to be a throwaway page turned into this mini project!

                            The Process
                        </p>
                        <p class="modal-description">
                            I had quite the rough start. At the time, I've only ever coded in Java and C++, so HTML and CSS seemed extremely foreign to me. While I quickly familiarzed myself with HTML, CSS was an absolute pain. My lack of artistic sense coupled with my OCD did not help much, either. I still remember being extremely frustrated because I could not vertically center an element inside a div box even after hours of research on the internet. As I discovered more tools such as Flex Box and picked up JavaScript, I began recoding certain parts of the site and even went as far as to starting the page from scratch. My confidence in my front-end skills solidified further with every piece of code I rewrite. I'm still constantly making changes and am excited to try out some of the newer features provided by HTML6 and CSS4.

                            It was an amazing experience. I picked up on a ton of things throughout this entire thing. I learned the basics of creating a responsive and interactive site. I learned about colour theory so that I won't dress like a Christmas tree in the future. I learned how to add interactivity using JavaScript/TypeScript. I relearned how to use Illustrator and Photoshop to create some SVG animations. Most importantly, I learned how to vertically center an element in a div box!

                            My first exposure to programming was back in 2012 when I was still in grade 10. My first assignment was to make a rectangle oscillate left and right using simple if statements. At the time, I was completely blown away because it completely changed my understanding of how programs and applications worked.

                        <p class="modal-description">
                            Brick Breaker was the very first game I attempted to recreate. I coded the game up using Visual Basic. By coding, I meant dragging and dropping a lot of shapes onto a form. I also had no idea what loops were at the time, so I had to copy and paste a lot of brick code while manually changing the (x,y) coordinates. I was so into programming my game that I pulled a few all-nighters implementing various features such as power-ups and difficulty level. In retrospect, the code was definitely littered with redundancy and other unappealing characteristics. However, I thought that the game turned out pretty good for a novice.

                            My second attempt at recreating a game went much more smoothly. This time, I was tasked to code Space Invaders using Java. Graphics was much more challenging this time as I was no longer able to drag and drop shapes onto a form like I could with Visual Basic. However, the whole process was much quicker because I learned what nested loops were, so creating and updating the invaders was much easier. Unfortunately, I did not know about classes or anything related to object-oriented programming, so the game was still riddled with redundancy. I also never figured out a way to make my double buffer work, so the end product had a blinking grid of invaders. Regardless, the game was quite functional and playable.

                            On top of natural languages, I finally picked up two programming languages (I no longer remember Visual Basic, though). I felt as if I were an alchmist learning about chemistry since programming completely changed my view of how computer applications worked. Recreating the two games definitely taught me a lot about programming and gave me a great foundation as I continued studying computer science.

                            The first part of the project was mainly to implement the JSON and XML parsers to transform the API responses into something useable. While the coding portion was simple, making sense of the raw API responses was quite the challenge. I was also introduced to JUnit and IntelliJ's powerful debugger, powerful tools to verify code behaviour and to pinpoint bugs.

The user is further able to query the transit schedules at stations of their choice.

I had never created a mobile application before, so seeing the application run natively on my Galaxy Note was definitely a cool experience.

For the last part, REST endpoints were created to finalize the API. All of the code were debugged using the Mocha test framework.

I was also able to experiment a bit with some frameworks such as Angular and React, though I settled for vanilla JavaScript and JQuery as the former was completely overkill for my needs.
